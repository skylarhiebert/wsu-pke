wsu-pke is a public-key cryptosystem based on the RSA public-key cryptosystem as described by Dr. Sarah Mocas as an assignment for CS 427 - Computer Security at Washington State University Vancouver. 

The program will generate public/private keyfiles, encrypt a given plaintext file using provided public keyfile, or decrypt a given ciphertext file using provided private keyfile.

Usage: wsu-pke [OPTION]... [-k|-e|-d] FILE1 FILE2
Encrypt or Decrypt FILE2 with a key of FILE1 to standard output
	Default method is encryption

	-e	Encrypt FILE1 with key FILE2
	-d	Decrypt FILE1 with key FILE2
	-h			Output text to hexidecimal representations
	--debug	Display debug text to stdout
	--help			Display this help and exit
	--version		Output version information end exit

Examples:
	wsu-pke --debug -e keyfile plaintextfile
	wsu-pke -d keyfile cipherfile
